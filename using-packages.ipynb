    "\n",
    "### Why do I need a package manager?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are learning Python (or any other language), you are probably doing it to leverage the power of prebuilt packages. In Python a few of the most well known packages are Numpy, Scipy, or Pandas. Another package you may be less aware of is Django a web framework used for building websites. In fact instagram uses Django to build their website/app.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install any of these packages you will need to use a package manager. However, to install packages safely we need to think about environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Why do I need an environment?\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem like we are moving away from using a package like our initial goal. However, lets motivate the use of an environment using a lab-work analogy. In a lab any given experimental setup starts from a clean bench. A new experiment requires a clean bench, in the lab this means scrubbing the bench removing bacteria, foreign objects or chemicals. Thankfully creating a sterile or clean environment on a computer is much easier. We need to do this to make sure one python package installed does not interact with another. An environment is essentially like a clean room isolating one package configuration from another. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How do I do it?\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the environment using `venv`. Here `python3 -m` means python run a module from the command line then `venv` is the name of the module, `env` is the name of our environment. We can choose any name we like here so for other projects you can use a descriptive name such as `proj-shorthand-env`.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can go to the website and search for a package, use a search engine with a search like [\"python package linear algebra PyPI\"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=python+package+linear+algebra+PyPI&ia=web) which will help you find the packages you need.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you have installed many packages you may want to run your code on another computer (e.g. a server, on HPC, in the cloud) or give your code to someone else. In these instances you need to also give them your environment the reasons for this are numerous but two worth mentioning:\n",
    "    1. It saves the user(or you) a lot of time if they have a list of whats needed.\n",
    "    2. Some packages will have minor differences in output between versions that could change the result.\n",
